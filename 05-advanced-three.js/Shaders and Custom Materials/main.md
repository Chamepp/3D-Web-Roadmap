# Shaders and Custom Materials

Welcome to the "Shaders and Custom Materials" section of the 3D Web Development Roadmap. In this section, you will explore the fascinating world of shaders and custom materials to create unique and visually stunning 3D experiences in your web projects.

## Overview

Shaders and custom materials allow you to control how light interacts with objects in your 3D scenes. By diving into shaders, you can achieve various visual effects, such as realistic lighting, reflections, and shadows, as well as create artistic and stylized looks.

## Topics Covered

1. Understanding Shaders
   - Introduction to Vertex and Fragment Shaders
   - GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) Basics
   - Shader Compilation and Linking
   - Passing Data to Shaders

2. Common Shader Effects
   - Phong Shading
   - Gouraud Shading
   - Texture Mapping
   - Normal Mapping
   - Specular Mapping

3. Writing Custom Shaders
   - Creating a Basic Shader Program
   - Implementing Custom Lighting Models
   - Advanced Shading Techniques

4. Post-Processing Effects
   - Introduction to Post-Processing
   - Creating a Simple Post-Processing Pipeline
   - Applying Filters (e.g., Bloom, Blur, Depth of Field)

## Examples and Projects

Throughout this section, you will find practical examples and projects that demonstrate how to apply shaders and custom materials to enhance the visual quality and realism of your 3D web applications. These examples will also serve as starting points for your own creative explorations.
