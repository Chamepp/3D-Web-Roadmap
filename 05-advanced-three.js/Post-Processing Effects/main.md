# Post-Processing Effects

In the "Post-Processing Effects" section, we will explore how to enhance the visual quality of your 3D web projects using post-processing effects. Post-processing effects allow you to apply various filters and adjustments to the rendered scene, giving you the power to create stunning and immersive visuals.

## Topics Covered

- Overview of Post-Processing Effects in Three.js
- Setting up the Post-Processing Pipeline
- Common Post-Processing Effects
  - Bloom
  - Depth of Field
  - Motion Blur
  - Chromatic Aberration
  - Vignette
- Creating Custom Post-Processing Shaders
- Combining Multiple Effects for Unique Looks

## Prerequisites

Before diving into post-processing effects, make sure you are familiar with the basics of Three.js and WebGL. If you haven't already, we recommend completing the following sections from the roadmap:

- [WebGL Fundamentals](../WebGL-Fundamentals)
- [Three.js Basics](../Three.js-Basics)

## Tutorials and Examples

Each topic in this section will be accompanied by step-by-step tutorials and practical examples. You'll find detailed explanations and code snippets to implement various post-processing effects in your Three.js projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with post-processing effects, you'll need to have a development environment set up with Three.js integrated. You can refer to the [Getting Started with Three.js](../Three.js-Basics/getting-started-with-threejs.md) tutorial if you need help with the initial setup.
