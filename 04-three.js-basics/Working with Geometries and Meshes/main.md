# Working with Geometries and Meshes

In 3D web development, understanding and manipulating geometries and meshes are fundamental skills. Geometries define the shape and structure of 3D objects, while meshes combine geometries with materials to create visually appealing and interactive 3D elements. This section will cover the basics of working with geometries and meshes using Three.js.

## Introduction to Geometries

Geometries in Three.js represent the shapes of 3D objects, such as cubes, spheres, cylinders, and more. They define the vertices, faces, and other properties of the objects. In this section, you'll learn the basics of geometries and how to use them to create simple 3D shapes.

## Common Geometries

Explore the most commonly used pre-built geometries provided by Three.js, such as BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry, PlaneGeometry, and CylinderGeometry. You'll learn how to create these shapes and add them to your 3D scenes.

## Creating Custom Geometries

In some cases, you might need custom geometries that aren't available in the standard Three.js library. This section will teach you how to create custom geometries by defining their vertices and faces manually.

## Introduction to Meshes

Meshes combine geometries with materials, enabling you to render 3D objects in the scene. This section introduces you to Three.js Meshes and how they work with geometries to display 3D content.

## Working with Materials

Materials define how the surface of a mesh appears when rendered. Learn about different types of materials provided by Three.js, including MeshBasicMaterial, MeshLambertMaterial, and MeshPhongMaterial.

## Applying Textures to Meshes

Textures add realistic details and visual complexity to 3D objects. This section demonstrates how to apply textures to meshes using Three.js to create more visually appealing scenes.

## Manipulating Meshes in the Scene

Discover how to position, rotate, and scale meshes in the 3D scene. Learn about object transformations and how to manipulate meshes to create dynamic and interactive 3D content.

## Examples and Projects

This section showcases practical examples and projects that demonstrate the concepts covered in this topic. You'll find interactive demos and sample code to help solidify your understanding of working with geometries and meshes.
