# How Three.js Works

## Introduction

Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to create and render 3D content in web browsers. It provides an easy-to-use API for working with 3D graphics, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers. This README will give you an overview of how Three.js works and how you can get started with it.

## Features

- Rendering: Three.js handles the rendering of 3D scenes using WebGL, a low-level API for rendering 3D graphics in the browser. WebGL takes advantage of the GPU's capabilities, making 3D rendering fast and efficient.

- Scene Graph: Three.js uses a scene graph data structure to organize and manage objects in a 3D scene. The scene graph makes it easy to position, rotate, and scale objects relative to each other.

- Geometries and Meshes: Three.js provides various built-in geometries (e.g., cubes, spheres, planes) that you can use to create 3D objects. These geometries can be combined with materials to create meshes, which are the building blocks of 3D models.

- Materials and Shading: Three.js supports various materials that determine how objects interact with light. You can choose between basic materials (e.g., Lambert, Phong) or create custom shaders for more advanced effects.

- Lighting: Lighting is essential for creating realistic 3D scenes. Three.js supports different types of lights, such as ambient, directional, point, and spotlights, to illuminate your scenes.

- Cameras: Three.js allows you to use various camera types (e.g., PerspectiveCamera, OrthographicCamera) to control the view of your 3D scenes.

- Animation: Three.js makes it easy to animate objects in your 3D scenes. You can animate position, rotation, scale, and any other object property.

- Interactivity: You can add interactivity to your 3D scenes by handling mouse and touch events, allowing users to interact with and manipulate objects.
