# Creating Scenes, Cameras, and Renderers

In the world of 3D web development, creating and managing scenes, cameras, and renderers is fundamental to display 3D content on the browser. In this section, you'll learn how to set up a basic scene, configure cameras to view the 3D content from different perspectives, and use renderers to display the scenes on the browser.

## Introduction to Scenes

A scene is the canvas on which you place and arrange 3D objects, lights, and cameras to create a 3D environment. In this section, you'll learn how to set up a scene, manage objects within it, and customize the environment to suit your needs.

## Cameras in 3D

Cameras define the perspective from which the 3D scene is viewed. Different camera types offer various viewpoints, such as perspective or orthographic views. You'll explore how to create cameras, position them in the scene, and set up controls for user interaction.

## Renderers and Frame Rate

Renderers are responsible for rendering the 3D scene onto the browser window. Understanding renderers is crucial for optimizing the performance of your 3D web applications. In this section, you'll learn about different rendering techniques and how to manage the frame rate effectively.

## Working with Multiple Scenes

Sometimes, you may need to work with multiple scenes within a single web application, such as having separate scenes for different parts of a game or interactive experience. Learn how to create and manage multiple scenes and switch between them seamlessly.

## Creating Interactive Viewports

Interactive viewports allow users to navigate and interact with 3D content in real-time. You'll explore techniques for creating user-friendly viewports that enable panning, zooming, and rotating the 3D scene to provide a more engaging user experience.

## Project: Building a Simple 3D Scene

In this project, you'll apply the knowledge gained throughout this section to build a simple 3D scene. You'll create a scene, add objects, set up cameras, and render the scene on the browser. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding of creating scenes, cameras, and renderers.
