## Introduction to Lighting in 3D

In this introductory module, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of lighting in 3D graphics. You'll learn about the role of light in 3D scenes, how lighting affects the appearance of objects, and the basic types of lighting models.

## Ambient Light and Diffuse Reflection

Understanding ambient light and diffuse reflection is crucial for creating realistic lighting effects. This module will delve into how these components contribute to the overall lighting of a 3D scene and how they interact with different surfaces.

## Specular Reflection and Highlights

Specular reflection creates shiny highlights on surfaces, adding depth and realism to your 3D scenes. This module will explain how specular highlights work and how to control their appearance in your projects.

## Point Lights and Directional Lights

Point lights and directional lights are two common light sources used in 3D rendering. This module will explore the differences between them and how to implement both in your 3D web applications.

## Working with Shadows

Shadows play a crucial role in creating depth and realism in 3D scenes. This module will guide you through techniques for casting and rendering shadows in your 3D projects.

## Global Illumination Techniques

Global illumination simulates how light bounces and interacts with the environment, producing more realistic lighting effects. In this module, you'll learn about techniques like radiosity and photon mapping for achieving global illumination in 3D web applications.

## Advanced Shading Models

This module will introduce you to advanced shading models, such as the Phong shading model and the Blinn-Phong shading model, which allow you to achieve smoother and more sophisticated lighting effects in your 3D scenes.

## Real-time vs. Precomputed Lighting

Real-time and precomputed lighting are two approaches to handle lighting in 3D web development. This module will compare the pros and cons of each method and when to use them in your projects.

## Lighting in Three.js

Three.js is a popular JavaScript library for 3D web development. In this module, we'll explore how to implement lighting and shading using Three.js to create stunning 3D visuals.

## Optimization and Performance Tips

In this final module, we'll discuss optimization techniques for lighting and shading in 3D web applications. You'll learn how to achieve great visuals without sacrificing performance.
