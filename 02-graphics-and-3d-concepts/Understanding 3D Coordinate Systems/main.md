## Introduction to 3D Coordinate Systems

In this introductory section, you'll learn the basics of 3D coordinate systems. We'll explore how 3D space is represented using three axes (X, Y, and Z) and how these axes relate to the real world. Understanding the fundamentals of 3D coordinates is crucial for creating and positioning objects in a 3D scene.

## Cartesian Coordinate System in 3D

This section will delve deeper into the Cartesian coordinate system as it applies to 3D graphics. You'll explore how to represent points and positions in 3D space using Cartesian coordinates and how to perform basic operations like translation, rotation, and scaling.

## Right-Handed vs. Left-Handed Coordinate Systems

In this part, we'll cover the differences between right-handed and left-handed coordinate systems. Understanding these distinctions is essential when working with various 3D libraries and APIs, as some might use one system over the other.

## World, Local, and Screen Coordinates

In 3D development, it's essential to comprehend the differences between world, local, and screen coordinates. This section will explain each coordinate system's purpose and how to convert between them to manipulate objects accurately.

## Transformations in 3D Space

In the final section of this segment, we'll explore transformations in 3D space. You'll learn about translation, rotation, and scaling matrices and how to apply these transformations to 3D objects to achieve different effects in your 3D scenes.
