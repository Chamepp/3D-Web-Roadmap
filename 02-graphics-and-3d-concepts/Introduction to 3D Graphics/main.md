## What is 3D Graphics?

3D graphics refer to the representation of three-dimensional objects and scenes in a two-dimensional medium, such as a computer screen. Unlike traditional 2D graphics, 3D graphics add depth and realism to visual content, creating a more immersive and interactive experience for users.

In this section, we'll explore the core principles behind 3D graphics, understand how to create and manipulate 3D objects, and delve into the mathematical concepts that underpin 3D rendering.

## Coordinate Systems in 3D

Understanding coordinate systems is essential in 3D graphics. We'll explore how 3D space is represented using Cartesian coordinates, where the X, Y, and Z axes define the three dimensions. Additionally, we'll learn about different coordinate systems, such as object space, world space, and camera/view space, and how transformations are used to move and orient 3D objects within a scene.

## Working with 3D Models and Textures

In this section, we'll dive into the exciting world of 3D modeling and texturing. You'll learn how to import 3D models into your web projects, apply textures to surfaces, and manipulate the appearance of 3D objects. We'll also cover common file formats for 3D models and textures, ensuring compatibility across various 3D libraries and tools.

## Lighting and Shading in 3D

Lighting and shading are critical aspects of 3D graphics that contribute to the realism of a scene. We'll explore different lighting models, such as ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, and understand how light interacts with 3D objects to produce visually appealing effects. Additionally, we'll cover shading techniques to create smooth surfaces and achieve various artistic styles.
