## Introduction to 3D Models

Before diving into the specifics of working with 3D models, we'll begin with an overview of different types of 3D models commonly used in web development. We'll discuss the differences between polygonal models, parametric models, and volumetric models, and their applications in various scenarios.

## Importing 3D Models

In this section, we'll explore various formats for 3D models and learn how to import them into our web projects. We'll cover techniques to load 3D models from external files and resources and how to optimize loading times to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Manipulating 3D Models

Once we have imported 3D models into our scenes, we need to understand how to manipulate them dynamically. This includes translation, rotation, scaling, and other transformations to create interactive and responsive 3D experiences.

## Texture Mapping

Texture mapping is a critical aspect of 3D web development. We'll learn how to apply textures to 3D models to add visual details and realism to our scenes. This section will cover basic texture mapping techniques and how to adjust textures for different surfaces.

## UV Mapping

In this part of the section, we'll delve deeper into UV mapping, a process that involves unwrapping 3D models to a 2D plane for efficient texture mapping. We'll explore different UV mapping techniques and how to use tools to create UV maps for complex models.

## Texture Filtering and Optimization

To optimize 3D web experiences, we need to consider texture filtering and compression techniques. This section will cover texture filtering methods to enhance rendering quality and texture optimization techniques for improved performance.
