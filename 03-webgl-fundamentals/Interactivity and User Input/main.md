# Interactivity and User Input

In the world of 3D web development, interactivity plays a crucial role in engaging users and providing immersive experiences. This section will cover topics related to handling user input and creating interactive elements within your 3D web applications.

## Topics Covered

- Event Handling in 3D
- Mouse and Touch Interaction
- Keyboard Input in 3D
- User Interface Elements
- Handling Gestures and Touch Controls
- Implementing Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- Interactive 3D Models and Scenes
- Creating Custom Interactions with Three.js
- WebXR Interactivity (AR/VR)

## Tutorials and Examples

1. **Basic Event Handling in Three.js**
   - Learn how to handle click and hover events on 3D objects using Three.js event listeners.
