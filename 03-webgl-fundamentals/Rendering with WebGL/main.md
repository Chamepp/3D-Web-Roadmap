## Introduction to WebGL

This section introduces you to WebGL, explaining what it is, how it works, and why it's essential for 3D web development. You'll get an overview of the WebGL API and its core concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into WebGL, you should have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Familiarity with basic 3D graphics concepts will also be helpful but not mandatory.

## Getting Started

In this part, you'll set up your development environment and create a basic HTML template for WebGL. You'll learn how to include the necessary libraries and resources for rendering 3D graphics in your web page.

## Rendering a Triangle

Start your journey into WebGL by rendering a simple 3D triangle on the screen. This step will give you a hands-on experience with the core concepts of creating and rendering basic shapes using WebGL.

## Working with Shaders

Shaders are a fundamental part of WebGL, as they define how your 3D objects are rendered on the screen. In this section, you'll explore vertex and fragment shaders and understand how they work together to create stunning visuals.

## Managing Buffers and Attributes

To render complex 3D models, you'll need to manage buffers and attributes efficiently. This section covers buffer objects and how to use attributes to define vertex data for rendering.

## Textures and Image Loading

Learn how to apply textures to 3D objects to add visual richness to your scenes. You'll also discover various techniques for loading images and textures for use in WebGL applications.

## Transformations and Matrices

Understanding transformations and matrices is crucial for positioning and animating objects in 3D space. This section will teach you how to apply translation, rotation, and scaling to your 3D models.

## Camera and View Projections

A camera is essential for viewing your 3D scenes. Here, you'll learn about the concept of view projections and how to set up a camera to navigate your 3D environment.

## Depth and Z-buffering

Discover the concept of depth and z-buffering, which allows you to handle occlusions and render 3D objects in the correct order for a realistic scene.

## Handling User Input and Interaction

In this section, you'll learn how to handle user input, such as mouse and keyboard events, to create interactive 3D experiences.

## Lighting and Shading Techniques

Enhance the realism of your 3D scenes by implementing lighting and shading techniques. This section covers different types of lighting models and shading algorithms.
