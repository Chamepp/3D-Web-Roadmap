# Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Review

Welcome to the Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Review section of the 3D Web Development Roadmap! Before diving into 3D web development and specific libraries like Three.js and cannon.js, it's essential to have a solid understanding of the foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## HTML Review

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. It provides the structure and content of a web page. If you're new to HTML or need a quick refresher, here are the fundamental concepts to review:

- Document Structure: Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document, including `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Elements and Tags: Familiarize yourself with various HTML elements and their uses, such as headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and more.
- Attributes: Learn how to use attributes like `class`, `id`, and `src` to add additional information to HTML elements.
- Links and Images: Review how to create hyperlinks (`<a>`) and embed images (`<img>`).

## CSS Review

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. A solid grasp of CSS is essential to style your 3D web applications effectively. Review the following key concepts:

- Selectors and Properties: Understand how to use CSS selectors to target HTML elements and apply styles using various properties like `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, and `padding`.
- Layout: Review CSS layout techniques, including the Box Model, Flexbox, and Grid, to create responsive and well-structured web pages.
- Styling Text: Learn about styling text with properties like `font-family`, `text-align`, `text-decoration`, etc.
- CSS Transitions and Animations: Familiarize yourself with basic animation concepts using CSS transitions and keyframe animations.

## JavaScript Review

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that enables interactivity and dynamic content on web pages. To build interactive 3D web applications, you should have a solid understanding of JavaScript. Review the following topics:

- Variables and Data Types: Refresh your knowledge of JavaScript variables and various data types like numbers, strings, arrays, and objects.
- Functions: Understand how to declare and call functions to organize your code and make it more reusable.
- DOM Manipulation: Learn how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to access and modify HTML elements dynamically.
- Events: Review event handling in JavaScript to respond to user actions like clicks and key presses.
- Asynchronous Programming: Familiarize yourself with asynchronous JavaScript using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Additional Resources
