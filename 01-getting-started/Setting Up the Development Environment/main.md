# Setting Up the Development Environment
Before you start diving into 3D web development, you'll need to set up your development environment properly. This section will guide you through the process of getting everything ready.

- **Installing Code Editor:** Choose a suitable code editor for web development, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. We recommend using Visual Studio Code due to its extensive plugin ecosystem and developer-friendly features.

- **HTML Boilerplate:** Create a basic HTML boilerplate to serve as the foundation for your 3D projects. Understand the structure of an HTML file and how to link external resources like CSS and JavaScript.

- **Local Development Server:** Set up a local development server to run your web applications. You can use simple solutions like "Live Server" (a Visual Studio Code extension) or more advanced setups with Node.js and Express.

- **Version Control with Git:** Learn the basics of Git version control to manage your project's codebase effectively. Initialize a Git repository and create your first commit.

- **Package Manager:** Utilize a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn to manage dependencies for your projects. This will be essential when using libraries like Three.js and cannon.js.

- **Basic JavaScript Setup:** Ensure your JavaScript environment is set up correctly with the latest ECMAScript standards. Familiarize yourself with modern JavaScript concepts like ES6 modules and arrow functions.

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Get acquainted with the developer tools available in modern web browsers. Understand how to inspect and debug your 3D web applications effectively.

- **Understanding Three.js Dependencies:** Learn about the required libraries and dependencies for using Three.js in your projects. Install and set them up properly to start working with Three.js.

- **External Assets:** Familiarize yourself with external assets like 3D models, textures, and images. Learn how to load and use them in your 3D scenes.

- **Code Linter and Formatter:** Set up a code linter and formatter to maintain a consistent coding style and catch potential errors in your code.

- **Webpack and Bundling:** Consider using Webpack or a similar bundler to optimize and bundle your 3D web applications for production.
